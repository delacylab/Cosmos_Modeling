# Cosmos Modeling
This repository contains Structured Query Language (SQL) scripts used to extract data marts from the _Expertly Determined De-Idnetified_ (EDDI) database hosted on the Cosmos server, as well as Python scripts for cleaning, preprocessing and modeling these data marts on the assigned project server. 

The entire workflow was conducted within the Cosmos _Data Science Virtual Machine_ (DSVM) environment, which prohibits the export of line-level data to ensure compliance with privary and security standard. _VSCodium_, a freely licensed code editor developed by Mircosoft, serves as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python within the DSVM. Accordingly, most Python scripts in this repository are provided in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format to facilitate transparency and reproducibility.
